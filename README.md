This is an Arduino Shield to interface an Arduino to a souvenir making machine.  

The shield contains signal conditioning to give the Arduino more ESD protection as a controller  for the penny press.  

The shield also contains an output level shifter to allow the Arduino to control solid-state relays  that require 12V control inputs.  

The shield also contains a 128x64 pixel display as a debugging aid, and a non-volatile serial memory for storing operational and debug data.  

The shield could serve as a general-purpose I/O conditioning module along with non-volatile memory that could allow the Arduino to retain its
operational state through power failures, by means of appropriate software.
